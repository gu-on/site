excerpt: Tips for using convolution filtering as a tool for sound design.
---
During my second year at university, I became interested in audio manipulation and digital signal processing. During this time, I came across a form of cross-synthesis known as convolution, which allows for the characteristics of one sound to be mapped to another. With the right approach, convolution can be a powerful tool for creative sound design.

Inspired by sound designers such as Diego Stocco, my GAN talk gives an overview of some less common ways to use convolution, outside of its more traditional use as a method for simulating reverb. I cover rhythmic convolution, guitar cab emulation, and creating dub-style delays, but many possibilities still exist beyond these.
