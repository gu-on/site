excerpt: A summary of my investigation in procedural audio during my time at university.
---
During this yearâ€™s round of Game Audio North talks, I gave an overview of procedural audio and had a look a few games using this technology. I ran through the two primary approaches (top-down & bottom-up) and showed how you might tackle a project with a more intuitive top-down mindset.

To demonstrate this, I created a PureData patch that simulates the sound of a recording I took of my electric fan. Without delving into the operational mechanics of the fan, I tried to approximate the features of the sound with simple signal generators and some filters.

I also briefly covered some of the research I undertook for my final year tech project, which culminated in an attempt at procedurally generating footfalls using granular synthesis. The resultant footfall synthesis still leaves a lot to be desired, but it did highlight the level of depth and nuance involved in simple interactions. These sorts of insights will become even more important as video games become more immersive and interactive, especially within virtual reality.
