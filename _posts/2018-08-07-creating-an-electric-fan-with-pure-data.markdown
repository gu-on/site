excerpt: Deconstructing source audio and rebuilding it with real-time controllable parameters.

This is a quick overview of how I went about synthetically creating the sound of an electric fan in Puredata. For reference, I have outlined my approach, the model adopted, and the type of synthesis in the video's description. I am aiming to create more content in future which will elaborate on what these aspects mean in practice.

This electric fan prototype was made without a specific context in mind, but as I get to grips with current game engines and programming, I hope to place more emphasis on the practical benefits of using procedural methods. I am still new to the fields of procedural audio and audio programming, so I'll likely go back over my work in future, aiming to achieve better sound quality and more efficiency.
